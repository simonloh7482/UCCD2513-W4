# UCCD2513-W4
UCCD2513 T14 Week 4 Activity

Activity 1:
Suggest two ways and write codes to display two images simultaneously. You can use any image snapped from your handphone, downloaded from internet or images from week 4 materials on MS teams. The two images are a color image and its corresponding grayscale image.

Activity 2:
Write codes that performs the following:
- Load the video “img_pexels.mp4” into the Python environment, resize it and display the videos with smaller frames. You can specify an arbitrary frame rate.
- Save it as a separate files: “smaller_img_pexels.avi” or “smaller_img_pexels.mp4”

Activity 3:
- Create a random noise color and grayscale image. You can set a custom width and height. (Hint: use Numpy functions like np.array and np.reshape.)
- Extract the region of interest (flower) from the 'flower.jfif’.
- Enlarge the image "dog.jfif" by using different techniques: 1) Linear interpolation, 2) Cubic interpolation and 3) nearest neighbor interpolation. Comment on the upscaled images.
